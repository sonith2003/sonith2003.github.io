           I'm Sonith and I have done my graduation in physics at Islamiah college .....and After my degree, I did a one‑year Honours Diploma in Computer Applications, where I developed a strong foundation in analytical thinking and problem‑solving and it also gave me good exposure to basic programming, office tools and general computer skills....and
Currently, I am focusing on building my career in the IT field as a Full Stack Developer. I am learning technologies related to full stack development step by step, and I regularly practice coding and small projects to improve my logical thinking and understanding of web development. Through this, I want to combine my analytical background in Physics with my technical skills in computers.
My goal is to become a skilled Full Stack Developer, work on real‑time projects, and grow into a reliable IT professional.
